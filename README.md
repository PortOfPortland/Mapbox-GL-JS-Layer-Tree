### Install
- [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install)
  - Note: You can install yarn via npm if you wish, but it's not ideal - `npm install -g yarn`
- `yarn` to install dependencies
  - Additional dependencies can be installed via `yarn add [package]`
- `gulp` to develop locally (includes a local server and watchers on index.html, js, and css files)
